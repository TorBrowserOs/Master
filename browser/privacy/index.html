          </h4>
          <p>
            The <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a>
            describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's products and
            services, including when you use Chrome browser and Chrome OS to access those products
            and services.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Google Chrome Privacy Notice describes the privacy practices that are specific to
            the Chrome family of products. This includes the Chrome browser, Chrome OS, and Safe
            Browsing. Some of the features described in this Privacy Notice are available in other
            web browsers (e.g. you may choose to use Safe Browsing features in Mozilla Firefox), so
            remember that you should also read the privacy policy for the browser in which the
            features are running.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not all of the features discussed in this Privacy Notice appear in all Chrome products.
            To keep things simple, however, we’re going to use the term "Chrome" on its own to
            refer to each of the products within the Chrome family. Where an individual Chrome
            product works in a different way we’ll be sure to highlight that.
          </p>
          <p>
            For early adopters who want to test features that are still under development, we make
            available preview versions (also known as beta, dev and canary) of Chrome browser and
            Chrome OS in addition to the stable version. Although this Google Chrome Privacy Notice
            applies to the stable and preview versions, it may not be fully up to date when
            describing features still under development in the <a href=
            "http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel">preview versions</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google will notify you of any material changes to this policy, and you will always have
            the option to use Chrome in a way that does not send any personally identifiable
            information to Google, or to remove your information and discontinue using it.
          </p>
          <p>
            For step-by-step guides to help manage your privacy preferences read our guide to
            <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/features.html#privacy">Browsers,
            Google Chrome, Privacy and You</a>.

          <h3>
            Information Google receives when you use Chrome
          </h3>
          <p>
            You do not need to provide any personally identifying information in order to use
            Chrome.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you use any browser, including Chrome, to contact Google's servers, by default
            Google receives <a href=
            "http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-server-logs">standard
            log information</a> including your system’s IP address and one or more <a href=
            "http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-cookie">cookies</a>.
            You can configure Chrome browser and Chrome OS to not accept <a href=
            "http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#%20toc-terms-cookie">cookies</a>
            from Google or other sites. Learn more about <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_cookies">configuring cookies and site
            data</a> in Chrome browser and Chrome OS.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you use Chrome to access other Google services, such as using the search engine on
            the Google homepage or checking Gmail, the fact that you are using Chrome does not
            cause Google to receive any special or additional personally identifying information
            about you.
          </p>

                If you choose Google as your search engine, Chrome will contact Google when it
                starts or when you change networks so as to determine the best local web address to
                send search queries. When you type URLs or queries in the Chrome address bar
                (omnibox) or App Launcher search box, the letters you type may be sent to your
                <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_search_engine">default search
                engine</a> so that the search engine’s prediction feature can automatically
                recommend terms or URLs you may be looking for. Additionally, for signed in users,
                the text that you type into the App Launcher search box can be sent to Google to
                provide recommendations for the contacts and the apps you might be looking for. If
                you accept a predicted query or URL, Chrome may send that information from the
                browser to your <a href=

                Chrome periodically contacts Google to perform functions such as checking for
                updates, checking connectivity status, validating current time, and estimating the
                number of active users. Each copy of Chrome browser includes a temporary
                randomly-generated installation number which will be sent to Google when you
                install and first use the product. The temporary number will be promptly deleted
                the first time that Chrome browser automatically checks for updates. If you
                received or reactivated your copy of the Chrome browser as part of a promotional
                campaign, it may also generate a non-unique promotional tag which is sent to Google
                when performing searches with Google and a unique token which is sent to Google
                when you first run and use the browser after installation, reinstallation, or
                reactivation. Chrome OS may send a non-unique promotional tag to Google
                periodically (including during initial set up) and when performing searches with
                Google. Furthermore, <a href=

                If you grant an application, extension, or website permission to use Google’s Cloud
                Messaging, or if you use Chrome Sync, Chrome generates a randomly chosen device ID.
                This device ID is shared with Google but not accessible to third parties, and is
                revoked once it is no longer in use or when the Chrome profile is removed. From the
                device ID, Chrome then derives a registration ID that is shared with applications,
                extensions, or websites to securely pass messages from Google’s servers to the
                browser.

                Chrome OS contacts Google during initial device setup to determine if the device is

                Google a list of hashed device identifiers that were possible matches, so Chrome OS

            Information Google receives when you use the Safe Browsing feature on Chrome or other
            browsers
          </h3>
          <p>
            Google Chrome and certain third party browsers (including some versions of Mozilla’s
            Firefox and Apple’s Safari) includes Google's Safe Browsing feature. Safe Browsing
            sends and receives information between the browser you are using and Google's servers
            about suspicious websites -- for example when you visit a site that is suspected to be
            a phishing or malware site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your browser will contact Google's servers periodically to download the most recent
            "Safe Browsing" list, containing known phishing and malware sites. Google does not
            collect any account information or other personally identifying information as part of
            this contact, but it does receive <a href=
            "http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-server-logs">standard
            log information</a>, including an IP address and one or more <a href=
            "http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-cookie">cookies</a>.
            The most recent copy of the list is stored locally on your system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each site you visit will be checked against the Safe Browsing list on your system. If
            there is a match against the list, your browser will send Google a hashed, partial copy
            of the site’s URL so that Google can send more information to your browser. Google
            cannot determine the real URL from this information. Read more <a href=

                potentially harmful sites and executable file downloads not already known by
                Google. Information regarding a potentially harmful site or executable file
                download (including the full URL of the site or executable file download) may be

                You can choose to send additional data to help improve Safe Browsing when you
                access a site that appears to contain malware. This data is sent when you close or
                navigate away from a Safe Browsing warning page. The reports contain data, such as
                the URL and contents of the website as well as the URL of the page that directed
                you to that site, that can be used by Google to verify whether the site is still

          <p>
            If Chrome’s network actions prediction features are enabled, Chrome may look up the IP
            addresses of all links on webpages and open network connections to load webpages
            faster. Sites can also use <a href=

            pre-load the links that you might click next.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you use Chrome in <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_incognito">incognito mode</a> or guest mode,
            it will not transmit any pre-existing <a href=
            "http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-cookie">cookies</a>
            to sites that you visit. Sites may deposit new <a href=

            "http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-cookie">cookies</a>
            will only be temporarily stored and transmitted to sites while you remain in incognito

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Basic browsing history information, for example the URLs of pages that you visit, a
                cache file of text and images from those pages, and a list of some <a href=
                "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_prerender">IP addresses linked from pages
                that you visit</a>.

              <p>
                A searchable index of most pages you visit (except for secure pages with "https"
                web addresses, such as some bank pages)

            </li>

            You can always choose to <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_delete_history">delete your browsing history
            information</a>, in whole or in part.

          <p>
            You can also limit the information Chrome stores on your system by using <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_incognito">incognito mode</a> or guest mode.
            The Chrome browser offers both modes. Incognito mode is useful if you would still like
            to have access to information from your existing profile, such as suggestions based on
            your browsing history, while you are browsing. Guest mode is useful if you would prefer
            to begin a browsing session without seeing information from any existing profiles. In
            either of these modes, Chrome will not store basic browsing history information such as
            URLs, cached page text, or IP addresses of pages linked from the websites you visit. It
            will also not store snapshots of pages that you visit or keep a record of your
            downloads (although this information could still be stored elsewhere on your system,
            e.g. in a list of recently opened files). New <a href=
            "http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-cookie">cookies</a>
            received in these modes will not be saved after you close your browser, close all open
            incognito windows or exit guest mode. You can see when you are in incognito / guest
            mode because the incognito icon appears in the top corner of your browser; in some
            cases the border of your browser window may also change color.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you make changes to your browser configuration, such as by bookmarking a web page
            or changing your settings, this information is also saved. These changes are not
            affected by incognito / guest mode.
          </p>

            You can choose to have Chrome save your passwords for specific websites. <a href=

          <p>
            In order to allow certain content to be accessed using Chrome browser for Windows or
            Chrome OS, Chrome may be required to provide selected content partners and websites
            using Adobe Flash Access with a unique identifier that is stored on your system. You
            can disable this feature in the settings or reset the unique identifier’s value by
            reinstalling the operating system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parties to whom your unique identifier is provided could associate it with
            personally-identifiable information you provide to them. Google’s use of a unique
            identifier to provide content from Google servers is subject to the Google Privacy

            Using apps, extensions, themes, services, and other add-ons with Chrome
          </h3>
          <p>
            You may use apps, extensions, themes, services and other add-ons ("Add-ons") with
            Chrome, including some that may be pre-installed or integrated with Chrome and some
            that you may obtain from <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web
            Store</a> or other sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before installing an Add-on, you should review the requested permissions. Add-ons may
            be designed to store, access, and share data stored locally or in your Google Drive
            account. Add-ons may use notifications that are sent through Google servers. Chrome may
            check for, download, and install updates to your Add-ons. Chrome may send usage
            indicators to Google for installed Add-ons. Some add-ons might require access to a
            unique identifier for digital rights management or for delivery of push messaging. You
            can disable the use of such an identifier by removing the add-on from Chrome.
          </p>
          <p>
            From time to time, Google may discover an Add-on that poses a security vulnerability or
            violates the developer terms for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome
            Web Store</a> or other legal agreements, laws, regulations or policies. Chrome may
            periodically download a list of such Add-ons from Google’s servers, and Google may
            remotely disable or remove such Add-ons from user systems in its sole discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Add-ons developed and provided by Google may communicate with Google servers and are
            subject to the <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy
            Policy</a> unless otherwise indicated. Add-ons developed and provided by third parties
            are the responsibility of such third parties and may be subject to third party privacy
            policies. For example, a version of the Adobe Flash Player plug-in is preinstalled with
